DataScience101 - Term Project Student Performance Analysis

The data for this project is downloaded from www.kaggle.com. At the time it was a trending data set on the kaggle site. It has good reviews for being clean and usable. It is described:

"Filename: Student_Performance.csv Rows: 15,000 Columns: 16

This file contains individually structured student records, where each row represents a single student along with their demographic profile, educational background, learning habits, and academic performance. The dataset combines behavioral, environmental, and academic factors, making it suitable for a wide range of educational and analytical applications.

The file includes information on:

Demographics: age, gender, school type Family background: parent education level Study-related habits: daily study hours, study method, internet access School engagement: attendance percentage, travel time, participation in extra activities Academic records: marks in Math, Science, and English Final outcomes: overall performance score and assigned grade

All values follow consistent formatting, column naming conventions, and realistic ranges to ensure ease of use. The dataset is clean, balanced, and ready for immediate download and analysis."

After I chose this database for my project, I did some furtherreading, I determined that the data is SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED. THis is consistent with what at some times seemed to be to data that was too perfect. While this is helpful from to avoid privacy issues, it make me quesiton the validity of my results.
